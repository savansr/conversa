## üìù How It Works

Conversa uses **Socket.IO** for real-time communication between clients and the server. Here's the basic flow:

1. **Connection**  
   - When a user opens the app, the client connects to the Socket.IO server.
   - The server assigns a unique `socket.id` to each connected client.

2. **Rooms**  
   - Users can join specific chat rooms by emitting a `joinRoom` event with the room ID.
   - The server adds the user to that room, enabling targeted communication.
   - Syntax example:
     ```javascript
     socket.join(roomId);
     ```

3. **Messaging**  
   - Users send messages specifying the room:
     ```javascript
     socket.emit('sendMessage', { roomId, message });
     ```
   - The server broadcasts the message only to users in that room:
     ```javascript
     io.to(roomId).emit('receiveMessage', message);
     ```

4. **Private Messaging**  
   - To send a message to a single user, the server can use the recipient‚Äôs socket ID:
     ```javascript
     io.to(socketId).emit('privateMessage', message);
     ```

5. **Other Real-Time Events**  
   - **Typing indicators**: Emit when a user is typing to others in the room.
   - **Read receipts**: Notify the sender when a message is read.

This architecture ensures real-time, scalable, and organized messaging between users.
